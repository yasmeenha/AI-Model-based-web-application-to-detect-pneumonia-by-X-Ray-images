Executive summary(Motivation):

          Our goal of the project is to empower radiologists with a Convolutional Neural Networks based AI model to predict the severity of pneumonia based on the X-ray images. As pneumonia is a deadly disease and the key to saving the lives of people is by detecting pneumonia in the early stages. In the past 2 years with the rise in Covid pandemic too, there was a rise in pneumonia affecting the lungs and there was a shortage of experienced radiologists. In such events an AI model with good accuracy can assist  junior doctors in predicting pneumonia from x-ray images in the initial stages of the disease and thus saving lives. [Reference 9,10]
